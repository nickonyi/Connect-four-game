### What I learned

There were two main motivations that led me to take on this project. The first was to gain a deeper understanding of the role Webpack plays in building modern websites. The second was to explore the use of factory modules for object creation and to understand how SOLID principles contribute to building applications that are modular, scalable, and maintainable.

I am pleased to say that both goals were achieved through this project. Webpack significantly simplifies development, especially when managing multiple files containing different routines. Without it, manually integrating all these files could have caused performance issues.

The second goal involved organizing key functionalities into separate modules. This separation of concerns made development much more efficient: whenever I encountered a bug, I knew exactly which module to examine. This structure not only simplifies maintenance but also makes it easier to add new features in the future.

### Continued development

The next step for me would be to deepen my familiarity with React. I plan to explore how Reactâ€™s component-based architecture can be used alongside the modular design principles I applied in this project. By learning React, I aim to understand how to efficiently manage state, handle events, and build reusable components, which will allow me to create more dynamic and interactive web applications. This will also help me strengthen my overall front-end development skills and prepare me for building scalable, maintainable projects in the future.
