    Rules Objective Be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs
    in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). How to play Red
    goes first in the first game. Players must alternate turns, and only one
    disc can be dropped in each turn. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row
    or a stalemate. The starter of the previous game goes second on the next
    game.-->
